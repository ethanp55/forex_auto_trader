This project uses various recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on various Forex currencies to try to make profitable trades.  The broker used here is Oanda (more info at https://www.oanda.com/) and their API is used to check the status of trades, place trades, grab market data, etc.  The program executes every 30 minutes (it looks at 30 minute charts) and determines if it should make a trade for a given currency.

The Procfile, requirements.txt, and runtime.txt files are needed for deployment on Heroku (https://heroku.com/).  If you are looking for cloud deployment (so you don't have to run this on your computer 24/7), Heroku is a great service and offers 1000 free hours/month for basic hosting/deployment if you verify a credit or debit card with them (there are only about 720 hours in a month, so if this is the only app you run then you won't have to pay anything).  There are other awesome services as well, such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform, but Heroku seemed a little easier to set up so I just went with that one.
