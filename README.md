This project uses various recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on various Forex currencies to try to make profitable trades.  The broker used here is Oanda (more info at https://www.oanda.com/) and their API is used to check the status of trades, place trades, grab market data, etc.  The program executes every 30 minutes (it looks at 30 minute charts) and determines if it should make a trade for a given currency.
